# WatchYourProfanityBot
A Discord Bot to censor swearwords/cuss words.

This started as a fun way to learn the discord API and discord.py.
Currently on trying to make this a bit more than that, an actual usable bot.
<br>
I would suggest using a venv for this. It is not required just suggested.<br>
This should be done in the project folder.
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
You will need some external libraries, but all can be installed from the requirements.txt file.<br>
Windows:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Liunx/MacOS:

```
pip3 install -r requirments.txt
```

You will also need to setup your own discord bot.<br>
I will add a text tutorial here soon.
<br>
You need to add your dicord bot token to the .env file. PLEASE NOTE this file maybe hidden on your OS.
<br>
All the swearwords/cusswords are in the swears.txt file. Please feel free to edit/add them.
